s:1354:"<p>If 'All-or-nothing' is checked, all test cases must be satisfied
for the submission to earn any marks. Otherwise, the mark is obtained
by summing the marks for all the test cases that pass
and expressing this as a fraction of the maximum possible mark.
The per-test-case marks can be specified only if the all-or-nothing
checkbox is unchecked. If using a template grader that awards
part marks to test cases, 'All-or-nothing' should generally be unchecked.</p>

<p>The mandatory penalty regime is a comma-separated list of penalties (each a percent)
to apply to successive submissions. These are absolute, not cumulative. As a
special case the last penalty can be '...' to mean "extend the previous
two penalties as an arithmetic progression up to 100". For example,
<code>0,5,10,30,...</code> is equivalent to <code>0,5,10,30,50,70,90,100</code>.
If there are more submissions than defined penalties, the last value is used.
Spaces can be used in lieu of commas as a separator.</p>

<p>The default penalty regime can be set site-wide by a system administrator using
Site administration &gt; Plugins &gt; Question types &gt; CodeRunner.</p>

<p>Set the penalty regime to '0' for zero penalties on all submissions.</p>

<p>The penalty regime is ignored and no penalties are applied if the quiz is
run using the 'Adaptive (no penalties)' behaviour.</p>
