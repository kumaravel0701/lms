s:1823:"<p>The sandbox language is the computer language used
to run the submission. This should not usually need altering from the value in the
parent template; tweak it at your peril.</p>

<p>Ace-language is the
language used by the Ace code editor (if enabled) for the student's answer.
By default this is the same as the sandbox language; enter a different
value here only if the template language is different from the language
that the student is expected to write (e.g. if a Python template is
used to preprocess a student's C program and then execute it in a subprocess).</p>

<p>Multi-language questions, that is questions that students can answer in
more than one language, are enabled by setting the Ace-language to a comma-separated
list of languages. Students are then presented with a drop-down menu to select
the language in which their answer is written. If exactly one of the languages
has an asterisk ('*') appended, that language is chosen as the default language,
which is selected as the initial state of the drop-down menu. For example,
an Ace-language value of "C,C++,Java*,Python3" would allow student to submit in
C, C++, Java or Python3 but the drop-down menu would initially show Java which
would be the default. If no default is specified the
initial state of the drop-down is empty and the student must choose a language.
Multilanguage questions require a special template that uses the {{ANSWER_LANGUAGE}}
template variable to control how to execute the student code. See the built-in
sample multilanguage question type. The {{ANSWER_LANGUAGE}} variable is defined
<i>only</i> for multilanguage questions.</p>

<p>If the author wishes to supply a sample answer to a multilanguage question,
they must write it in the default language, if specified, or the
first of the allowed languages otherwise.</p>
