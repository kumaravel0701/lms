In video games, some characters can _drop_ items or experience points on the ground for the player to pick up. These items and points are commonly referred to as drops.

In Level Up XP, drops are shortcodes (e.g. `[xpdrop id=1 secret=abcdef]`) that an instructor can place in regular Moodle content. When encountered by a user, these drops will be _picked up_ and a certain amount of points will be awarded.

At present, drops are invisible to the user and passively award points the first time they are encountered.

Drops can be used to cleverly award points when certain type of content is consumed by a student. Here are some ideas:

- Place a drop in the feedback of a quiz only visible for perfect scores
- Place a drop in deep content to reward their consumption
- Place a drop in an interesting forum discussion
- Place a drop in a hard-to-get-to page in a lesson module

Students will earn as many points as their grade.
A grade of 5/10, and a grade of 5/100 will both award the student 5 points.
When a student's grade changes multiple times, they will earn points equal to the maximum grade they have received.
Points are never taken away from students, and negative grades are ignored.

Example: Alice submits an assignment, and receives the mark of 40/100. In _Level Up XP_, Alice receives 40 points for her grade.
Alice reattempts her assignment, but this time her grade is lowered to 25/100. Alice's points in _Level Up XP_ do not change.
For her final attempt, Alice scores 60/100, she earns 20 additional points in _Level Up XP_, her total of points earned is 60.

Rules can be created in two scopes: sitewide and course-specific. Whenever possible, course-specific rules are assessed first, followed by sitewide rules. This approach enables educators to create broad rules applicable across the site (sitewide) and then adjust them for individual courses.

- Sitewide: These rules are effective across the entire site, except when course-specific rules are in place.
- Course: These rules are applicable only within a specific course. They have priority over sitewide rules.

By default, a portion of the leaderboard surrounding the current user will be displayed.

```
[xpladder]
```

To display the top 10 students instead of the neighbours of the current user, set the parameter `top`. You can optionally set the number of users to display like so `top=20`.

```
[xpladder top]
[xpladder top=15]
```

A link to the full leaderboard will automatically be displayed below the table, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

```
[xpladder hidelink]
```

By default, the table does not include the progress column which displays the progress bar. If such column has been selected in the additional columns in the leaderboard's settings, you can use the argument `withprogress` to display it.

```
[xpladder withprogress]
```

Note that when a course is using groups, the leaderboard will best guess which group to display the leaderboard of.
";s:19:"shortcode:xpiflevel";s:58:"Display the content when the current user's level matches.";s:24:"shortcode:xpiflevel_help";s:1037:"
Refer to the examples below to format this shortcode. When a level is strictly specified, the content will be displayed regardless of the other rules.
The _greater_ and _less than_ rules must all match for the content to be displayed. Watch out as that may sometimes result in the content to never be displayed!
Note that teachers, or otherwise users with editing capabilities, will always see everything.

```
[xpiflevel 1 3 5]
    Displayed if the user's level is exactly 1, 3 or 5.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >3]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater than 3.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >=3]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater or equal to 3.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >=10 <20 30]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater or equal to 10 AND is strictly less than 20
    OR is exactly equal to 30.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel <=10 >=20]
    Never displayed because the user's level can never be less or equal to 10 AND more or equal to 20.
[/xpiflevel]
```

Note that these shortcodes CANNOT be nested within one another.
";s:21:"shortcode:xplevelname";s:23:"Display the level name.";s:26:"shortcode:xplevelname_help";s:295:"
By default the tag displays the name of the current user's level.
Alternatively, you can use the `level` argument to display the name of a specific level.

```
[xplevelname]
[xplevelname level=5]
```

If the `level` argument is provided and the level does not exist, nothing will be displayed.
";s:18:"shortcode:xppoints";s:58:"Display a number of points formatted as experience points.";s:23:"shortcode:xppoints_help";s:354:"
By default, this shows the number of points of the current user. Alternatively, you can specify a number to override this value.

The styling of the points will depend on whether an arbitrary value is displayed or the current user's points. The argument `plain` can be used to remove any styling.

```
[xppoints]
[xppoints 500]
[xppoints 123 plain]
